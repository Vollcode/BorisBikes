This is an exercise in Object Oriented Design (OOD). We are to come up with a working program based on a user story.

Our task is to follow each step and do only what is asked of us within that step. To do feature testing and unit testing on anything we create.

We are to keep a copy of the daily code we write each day in a seperate branch named the different days we are working on them (ie. day-one, day-two ...). This is because we'll have different pairs everyday and it's a way to keep track of your code.
